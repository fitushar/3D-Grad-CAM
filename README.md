# 3D-Grad-CAM
Grad-CAM is a nice way to visualize what is your CNN model is actually looking for the prediction of the class with respect to the epecific Layer.


This repo contains a code to visualize Grad-CAM using Tensorflow 2.0. To know more about Grad-CAM please read this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02391.pdf
